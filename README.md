# Raspberry_armv7_builds
Repository of builds for Raspberry Pi 4  - no cross compilation - native device

If you want to install some python3 packages many time there is huge effort to find correct binary or whl file.
I built this files for own purpose however I hope it can be usefull for the others.
All files are builded with Raspberry Pi 4 device without using cross-compilation. 
Files are mainly for Python 3.8
